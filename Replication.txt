MySQL Replication
Replication means writing down of every change from source databse to one or more databases in a special file called binary log. By default replication is asynchronous 
There are two types of threaded process in mysql replication . 
1. I/O Thread
2. SQL Thread.
I/O Thread connects to source mysql instance and reads the binlog event and then copy to replica log in replicaserver 
SQL Thread read events from relay log and then applies them to replica instance as fast as possible.
Advantages
Scale-out-solutions, Data Security, Analytics and Long distance data distribution are the few advantages of replication
Configuring Replication
MySQL supports different types of replication in which traditional method is based on replicating events from source binary log
Newer method based on global transactional identifiers (GTID'S)
Types of Synchronisation
Replication in mysql support different types of synchronisation even though by default replication is asynchronous in which one server acts as source and other acts as replica
Asynchronous replication is contrast to synchronous which is same like NDB cluster.
Semisynchronous is supported in addition to the built-in asynchronous replication . semisynchronous replication supports delayed replication 
Replication Format
Two types of replication formats : 
1. Statement based replication (SBR)
2. Row Based replication (RBR)
3. Mixed Based Replication (MBR)
Replication Solutions
Replication can solve different problems like performancesupporting backups of different databases and larger solution to alleviate system failues.
